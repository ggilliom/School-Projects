About 15,000 years ago, the earth started to warm and the glacier stopped advancing. A thousand or so years later there was a sudden (by geological standards) increase in the earth's temperature and over the period of another thousand-plus years the glacier disappeared. There was so much water released by the melting ice cap that the Atlantic Ocean rose some 400 feet, more than three inches a year! About a thousand years ago, it was warm enough that the Vikings established settlements in Greenland and did farming. A mini Ice Age started around 1200 A.D. and among the victims were those same settlements—they disappeared.
