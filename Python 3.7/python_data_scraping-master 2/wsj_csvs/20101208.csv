The U.K. banking system has huge exposure to the euro zone, so it has as much at stake in the euro's future as many single-currency member. And if the crisis spreads beyond Portugal to Spain and Italy, the idea the rest of the euro zone would be able to provide a credible bailout without the support of the European Union's second-largest triple-A-rated borrower looks like a stretch.
