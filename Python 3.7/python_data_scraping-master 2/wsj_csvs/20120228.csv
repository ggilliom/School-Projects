But Mr. Buffett also singled out ""a largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have 'lost' their house through foreclosure have actually realized a profit."" That is because they extracted cash from their homes through refinancings before the crisis hit. In other words, they took the money and left, leaving banks with the loss. That may be true in some cases. But most foreclosed homeowners probably don't have much ""profit"" to show. And the sentiment is rich coming from Mr. Buffett, one of the country's wealthiest men. Plus his company, Berkshire Hathaway, is the largest single shareholder in Wells Fargo and has a big interest in Bank of America, which together will pay $17 billion toward the $25 billion national mortgage settlement related to foreclosure abuse.
