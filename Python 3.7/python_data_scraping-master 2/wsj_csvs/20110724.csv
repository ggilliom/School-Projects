13,Heard on the Street,'Snooze' on Debt Alarm,"Most deadlines have a bit of wiggle room. Does that even apply when politicians are dancing around the chance of a U.S. default? Treasury officials have been insisting the U.S. will hit its current $14.3 trillion debt ceiling Aug. 2. That has kept the heat on politicians to reach a deal to raise the nation's borrowing limit. But Barclays Capital doesn't believe Aug. 2 really is D-day. On Friday afternoon, it issued a note to clients saying Aug. 10 may actually be the date on which the Treasury will run out of cash to pay its obligations. That is mostly due to larger-than-expected tax receipts by the Treasury over the past week. Of course, BarCap isn't the final word here, but its calculations so far have tracked the Treasury's fairly well. An extra week might buy lawmakers time to reach a major deficit-reduction agreement alongside a debt-ceiling hike. If not, don't expect investors to fall for excuses like ""the dog ate our agreement.""",20110724
