25,Heard on the Street,Scary Signs,"Investors are desperate for any map to help navigate today's treacherous stock markets. One that might leave them seasick is relying on technical analysis from charts. First, there is the question of whether stocks are filling out a ""head-and-shoulders"" pattern, or an ""island reversal."" If the S&P 500 falls below its June lows, it would complete the head-and-shoulders (a high, a low, a higher high, a low, a high). Meanwhile, there are ominous signs of an island reversal. In that case, indexes fall rapidly between sessions, forming a ""gap"" in the days' trading ranges, and then quickly ""gap"" back higher. Should they occur, the two patterns are thought to signal a downturn ahead. Both these patterns require the S&P to fall under its 200-day moving average, 1277, itself another key chart figure. To complete the head and shoulders, the number is 1265â€”only 3.1% below Monday's closing level of 1305.",20110718
